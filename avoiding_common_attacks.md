# Avoiding Common Attacks

>**_REQUIREMENT:_**
```
Protect against two attack vectors from the "Smart Contracts" section with its SWC number

From Solidity Pitfalls and Attacks
Using Specific Compiler Pragma 
Proper Use of Require, Assert and Revert 
Use Modifiers Only for Validation 
Pull Over Push (Prioritize receiving contract calls over making contract calls)
Checks-Effects-Interactions (Avoiding state changes after external calls)
Proper use of .call and .delegateCall

From Smart Contract Pitfalls and Attacks
Not everything can be avoided, but you can write if youâ€™re taking protection against:
Re-entrancy
Timestamp Dependence
Forcibly Sending Ether
Tx.Origin Authentication
```

The contract applies the following measures to avoid common security pitfalls:
* Proper setting of visibility for functions - [SWC-100](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-100): 
  * ``external`` for functions that are only called by externally
  * ``public`` for functions that are called both internally and externally
  * ``payable`` for function that receives ETH payment
  * ``internal`` and ``private`` for functions that are used within the contract
* Using a specific pragma compile - Solidity 0.8.0 is used and not floating pragma - [SWC-103](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103)
* Low-level call return value is checked to handle the possibility that the call might fail - [SWC-104](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-104)
* Use ``require`` to check sender's balances and allowances, where applicable
* Use checks-effects-interactions in the ``withdraw`` and ``withdrawInERC20`` functions - [SWC-107](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-107)
* Use Openzeppelin's [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) to safeguard against reentrancy attack - [SWC-107](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-107)
* Use Openzeppelin's [Address](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol) library to validate ERC20 token contract addresses (eg. ``isContract()`` function)
* "Pull over Push" method for balance withdrawals
* Include ``fallback()`` and ``receive()`` functions in the contract to receive force-sending of ETH and add the amount to the contract balances
* Use Openzeppelin's ``SafeMath`` library to prevent integer overflow - [SWC-101](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-101)
